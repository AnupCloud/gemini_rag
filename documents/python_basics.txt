Python Programming Basics

Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability. Here are some fundamental concepts:

1. Variables and Data Types
   - Python supports various data types including integers, floats, strings, lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets.
   - Variables don't need explicit declaration: x = 5 creates an integer variable.
   - Strings can be defined with single or double quotes.

2. Control Flow
   - if/elif/else statements for conditional logic
   - for loops for iteration over sequences
   - while loops for conditional iteration
   - break and continue for loop control

3. Functions
   - Defined using the 'def' keyword
   - Can accept parameters and return values
   - Support default arguments and keyword arguments
   - Lambda functions for simple, anonymous functions

4. Object-Oriented Programming
   - Classes defined with 'class' keyword
   - Supports inheritance and polymorphism
   - Special methods like __init__ for constructors
   - Properties and methods for encapsulation

5. Common Built-in Functions
   - print(): Display output
   - len(): Get length of sequences
   - range(): Generate number sequences
   - type(): Check data type
   - input(): Get user input

6. Error Handling
   - try/except blocks for exception handling
   - finally for cleanup code
   - raise for throwing exceptions
   - Custom exception classes

Python's philosophy emphasizes code readability and simplicity, making it an excellent choice for beginners and professionals alike.
