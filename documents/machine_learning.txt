Machine Learning Fundamentals

Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables systems to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed.

Types of Machine Learning:

1. Supervised Learning
   - Uses labeled training data
   - Algorithm learns mapping from inputs to outputs
   - Examples: Classification, Regression
   - Common algorithms: Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, Support Vector Machines, Neural Networks

2. Unsupervised Learning
   - Works with unlabeled data
   - Finds hidden patterns or structures
   - Examples: Clustering, Dimensionality Reduction
   - Common algorithms: K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering, PCA, t-SNE

3. Reinforcement Learning
   - Learns through interaction with environment
   - Uses reward/penalty system
   - Examples: Game playing, Robotics
   - Common approaches: Q-Learning, Deep Q-Networks, Policy Gradients

Key Concepts:

Training and Testing:
- Dataset split into training and testing sets
- Training set used to build the model
- Test set used to evaluate performance
- Common split ratio: 70-30 or 80-20

Feature Engineering:
- Process of selecting and transforming variables
- Critical for model performance
- Includes normalization, encoding, and feature creation

Model Evaluation:
- Accuracy: Proportion of correct predictions
- Precision: True positives / (True positives + False positives)
- Recall: True positives / (True positives + False negatives)
- F1-Score: Harmonic mean of precision and recall
- Cross-validation for robust evaluation

Overfitting and Underfitting:
- Overfitting: Model too complex, performs well on training but poor on test data
- Underfitting: Model too simple, poor performance on both training and test data
- Regularization techniques help prevent overfitting

Popular ML Libraries:
- scikit-learn: General-purpose ML library
- TensorFlow: Deep learning framework by Google
- PyTorch: Deep learning framework by Meta
- Keras: High-level neural networks API
- XGBoost: Gradient boosting library
